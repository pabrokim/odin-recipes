    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Hummus pizza borrows heavily from the Italian pizza. It consists of round, flat base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with favorite veggies, and cheese baked at a high temperature. It uses hummus instead of the usual red sauce to give it a unique appearance for those bored with the traditional dish.  
    </p>
    <p>
        Hummus pizza is common in almost every part of the world. However, it is heavily consumed in Norway, the U.S, U.K, Germany, France, and Australia.
