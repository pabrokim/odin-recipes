# odin-recipes
In this project, I am going to build a basic recipe website. The website will have links to a few recipes. It will not be pretty since it only demonstrates basic html knowledge. 

After completing this project, I will be able to:
    1. Create repository on Github
    2. Clone/move the repository to my computer using the git clone command
    3. Create an index.html
    4. Add the usual boilerplate HTML
    5. Use different html elements and tags
    6. Commit changes
